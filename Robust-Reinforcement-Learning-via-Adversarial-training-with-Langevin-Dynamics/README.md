# LIONS-RL/Robust Reinforcement Learning via Adversarial training with Langevin Dynamics
1. `toy_example` is for Simple Simple Non-Convex-Concave SPPs (Section 4). Run `run.py` directly.
2. `simple_env` and `mujoco_env` plot the performance of the robust RL learned by GAD, Extra-Adam and MixedNE-LD.
